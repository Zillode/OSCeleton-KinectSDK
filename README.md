OSCeleton-KinectSDK
===================

What is this?
-------------

As the title says, it's just a small program that takes kinect
skeleton data from the KinectSDK (v1.7) framework and spits out the coordinates
of the skeleton's joints via OSC messages. These can can then be used
on your language / framework of choice.

This version of OSCeleton is compatible with the OSCeleton-OpenNI version (Zillode/OSCeleton-OpenNI).

Note: this version is incompatible with Sensebloom/OSCeleton!

How do I use it?
----------------

### Install Visual Studio 2012
### Install [Microsoft Kinect SDK (version 1.7)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/developer-downloads.aspx)
### Install [Microsoft Speech Platform SDK (version 11)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27226)
### Compile and run the SkeletonBasics solution

If you run the executable, it will send the OSC
messages in the Midas format to localhost on port 7110.
To learn about the OSC message format, continue reading below.


OSC Message format
------------------

### Joint message - message with the coordinates of each skeleton joint:
The messages will have the following format:

    Address pattern: "/Joint"
    Type tag: "siffffd"
    s: Joint name, check out the full list of joints below
    i: The ID of the user
    f: X coordinate of joint in real world coordinates (centimers)
    f: Y coordinate of joint in real world coordinates (centimers)
    f: Z coordinate of joint in real world coordinates (centimers)
    f: confidence value in interval [0.0, 1.0]
	d: timestamp in milliseconds since launch

Note: the Y coordinate is inverted compared to the default KinectSDK to be compatible with OpenNI.

### Face message - message with the coordinates of a face event:
The messages will have the following format:

    Address pattern: "/Face"
    Type tag: "iffffd"
    i: The ID of the user
    f: X coordinate of joint in real world coordinates (centimers)
    f: Y coordinate of joint in real world coordinates (centimers)
    f: Z coordinate of joint in real world coordinates (centimers)
    f: pitch of the head [-90, 90]
    f: pitch of the yaw [-90, 90]
    f: pitch of the roll [-90, 90]
	d: timestamp in milliseconds since launch

### FaceAnimation message - message with the coordinates of a face event:
The messages will have the following format:

    Address pattern: "/FaceAnimation"
    Type tag: "iffffd"
    i: The ID of the user
    f: lip raiser [-1, 1]
    f: lip stretcher [-1, 1]
    f: lip corner depressor [-1, 1]
    f: jaw lower [-1, 1]
    f: brow lower [-1, 1]
    f: brow raiser [-1, 1]
	d: timestamp in milliseconds since launch
